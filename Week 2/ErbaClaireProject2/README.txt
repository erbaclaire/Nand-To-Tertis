This folder contains HDL files that use implementations of logic gates to create the following combinational chips:

HalfAdder.hdl
FullAdder.hdl
Add16.hdl
Inc16.hdl
ALU.hdl

Subsequent combinational chips in the above list can be made with those previously implemented (including logic gates from Projects 1 and 2).
Combinational chips are made with as few parts as possible.
