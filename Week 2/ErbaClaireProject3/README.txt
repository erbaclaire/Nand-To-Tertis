This folder contains HDL files that use implementations of logic gates and combinational chips to create the following sequential chips:

(a)
Bit.hdl
Register.hdl
RAM8.hdl
RAM64.hdl
PC.hdl

(b)
RAM512
RAM4K
RAM16K

DFF is a new given gate.
Subsequent sequential chips in the above list can be made with those previously implemented (including logic gates and combinational gates Projects 1 and 2).
Sequential chips are made with as few parts as possible.
