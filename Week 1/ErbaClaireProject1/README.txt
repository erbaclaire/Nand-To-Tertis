This folder contains HDL files that use implementations of boolean logic to create the following elementary logic gates:

Not
And
Or
Xor
Not16
And16
Or16
Or8Way
Mux
DMux
Mux16
Mux4Way16
Mux8Way16
DMux4Way
DMux8Way

Nand is a given boolean operand.
Subsequent logic gates in the above list can be made with logic gates previously implemented.
Logic gates are made with as few parts as possible.
